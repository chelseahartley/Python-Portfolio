## Useful Links
**Dictionary API Link** - https://api.dictionaryapi.dev/api/v2/entries/en/(word)
(word) is being used as a placeholder for any word. <br> 
**For example:**
**https://api.dictionaryapi.dev/api/v2/entries/en/hello** will give you the api response for the word **'hello'.** <br> <br>

## Useful Commands:
Use `pip install colorama` to install the colorama module needed for the DictionaryConsoleApp. <br>

The below will display if the colorama module is already installed <br>

## Quick Python Explanations:
This is an example of a function used within my Python code - this specific function is fetching data from the Dictionary API used. The `def` is used to fetch the data and the block is ended with `return`. <br>

My Python code uses multiple in-built functions as well, including (but not limited to), the following: <br>
`print()` which prints to the console. <br>
`isInstance()` which checks an object or variable against a type or class used. <br>
Here is an example of both inbuilt functions in action: <br>
